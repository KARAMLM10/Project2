Portfolio Website - Read Me
This repository contains the source code and assets for my personal 
portfolio website. The website is built using Razer Pages, a lightweight web framework for .NET, and it showcases my projects, skills, and experiences.
The portfolio website serves as a showcase of my projects, skills, and experiences. 
It provides an overview of my work and allows visitors to explore different sections such as projects, skills, and contact information.

The Projects section displays a list of my notable projects with descriptions, screenshots, and links to live demos or repositories.

The Skills section highlights the technologies, programming languages, and tools that I'm proficient in.

The Contact section provides contact information, allowing visitors to reach out to me.

Feel free to explore the website and get in touch if you have any questions or inquiries.
